Create a Portfolio Website (Approximate Time: 3+hrs)

In this project, you will create a portfolio website to display your work experience and projects by coding along with the tutorial. You will create a new GitHub repo and deploy your app live using Netlify. Your task is to follow the video tutorial and customize the website to suit your own needs. You are provided starter files with assets to complete the tutorial, but you should replace portraits with your own beautiful faces and the example Resume with your own. 

Feel free to be creative and change any of the fonts, colors, styles, etc. Extra creativity and effort could result in bonus points!

 

Update: For fun and if you are looking for an extra challenge, there is a javascript library called three.js that lets you create 3D environments/experiences right in the browser. 

Example: https://jesse-zhou.com/Links to an external site.  So many possibilities for a portfolio. The main three.js site has a lot of demos: https://threejs.org/Links to an external site. 

 

By the end of this project, you will:

Create a multipart portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JS.
Build a website that is responsive on both desktop and mobile
Deploy a live website using Netlify.
Use GitHub for source control.
 

Tutorial: Building a Website PortfolioLinks to an external site.

 

Required Parts:

A navigation bar with the following links
 About: This is your profile/bio 
Experience: This is your Resume/CV 
Projects: this is your capstone design project 
        - Minimum of one project - use pictures and text to highlight your capstone design project.
        - Feel free to add more!
- (optional) Contact - this is in the tutorial, but you may omit it if you like.
Content: The actual content of the About, Experience, and Project Sections
A Footer
The page should be responsive - meaning it resizes on desktop and mobile. 
Created a new GitHub repo, uploaded the project, and made regular commits
Deployed website on Netlify or Github Pages 
As you work, you may want to look up various CSS and HTML properties that you want to customize or just understand better. 

You can search on w3schools to see examples and documentation for what parameters there are for each CSS property.

You can do the same with HTML: https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.aspLinks to an external site. 

 

Getting Started
To start, Download the starter files Download starter filesand rename your folder to: `portfolio-website-<name>`
This contained a folder with your assets that are the same as in the tutorial, along with four files. 
index.html - this is where you will write your HTML code - You can have more pages if you want.
styles.css - this is where you will write your CSS, which will let you design your page.
scripts.js - this is where you will put any JavaScript you may want to use. The tutorial has only a very small amount of js.
mediaqueries.css - this is just more CSS that will help make your website responsive (resizeable)
 

There are two ways you can handle version control:
1. Manually like we did in the first Skill builder exercise 
If you choose this: Don't forget to initialize git inside of your new folder:
If using the command line, navigate your file system until you are inside the portfolio-website folder, then initialize git : 
- run: git init 
- confirm: git status - Should say: `On branch main`
I recommend going ahead and creating your new repo and making an initial commit with the starter files + a readme.
After that, you can make a commit after completing each section of the project, i.e., About, Experience, Projects, etc. 
2. Use GitHub Desktop with VSCode as Shown in the tutorial.
Finally, Open the project in your code editor and follow the tutorial.
You may omit the contact form if you would like. It's up to you.
Make sure to replace the example resume/CV in the assets folder with your own.
